I remember reading a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Prophet-Remarkable-Scientists-Tomorrows/dp/0307961699) about two scientists who, while recognizing and agreeing on problems that our planet and the environment faces, had diametrically opposed views on possible solutions. 

The wizard believes in unconfined innovation. Progress will eventually solve all of our problems. Our civilization is extremely good at inventing solutions, if we have the right incentives. So let’s encourage the tech!

The prophet, on the other hand, thinks that using more and more resources in the pursuit of an endless prosperity will ruin the planet. It has only so much to give. Let’s cut back and regulate!

For me, it feels like the continuous run of tech misfires (surveillance tech, crypto, ad tech, social web, etc.) turned industry enthusiasts from wizards into prophets. While the previous period was all about growth by all means and an endless search for something new, I feel like, people are starting to look for products, that are predictable, stable and give control to the user. Which is understandable given how big of transformations are happening in the world right now. Change is tiresome, and naturally arises a request for the familiar and understandable.
