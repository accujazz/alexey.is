Every year modern cars look more and more aggressive.

This is Nissan Qashqai from 2008 to 2023.

The car is bigger, the headlights are narrower, the front grille more prominent. Even in stationary the car looks like it is frozen in a moment of flying 100 km/h. You can pick any other manufacture and get a pretty similar picture. It's dull.

It's not the only aesthetic that could look modern. Look at this beauty:

Or Rivian R1T:

Both cars don't scream "speed", they don't pretend to be a rocket, that could catapult you in a second from point A to B (while they definitely could, 'cause electric is generally more responsive and fast). Refreshingly, they look like friendly and useful companions.

Akin to a video game AI mate, that is always there to help.
