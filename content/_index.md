ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alexey. I'm a product manager and producer in video game space.

I started my career with a bootstrapped project that got me invited into my first full-time product management job.

I co-founded a video game discovery service with an open API, that was used by Microsoft, Unity, Newzoo, Blur and Yandex. I've worked with indie games, video games media and f2p products on bringing new projects to market.

Reach me at: hey [at] lyosha.net.
