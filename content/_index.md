# üëã Hi, I'm Alexey. 

I‚Äôm a product manager with over 10 years experience in building software products from the ground up.

I started my career with a bootstrapped project that got me invited into my first full-time product management job.

I launched RAWG, a video game discovery service with an open API, that was used by Microsoft, Unity, Newzoo, Blur and Yandex. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on a bunch of projects: media with in-house built editorial and social features, marketing tool for mobile game publisher, and digital game distribution service.

I‚Äôm always looking for interesting projects to collaborate on. If you have something in mind or would like to check my CV, reach me at: hi [at] alexeygornostaev.com.
