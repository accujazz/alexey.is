# üëã Hi, I'm Alexey. 

I‚Äôm a product manager with over 10 years experience in building software products from the ground up.

I started my career with a personal project that was noticed and got me invited into my first full-time product management job.

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on a bunch of video-game related projects: an infotainment database with personal recommendation tools, media with custom editorial and social features, mobile in-game marketing platform and digital game distribution service.

I wrote html/css, designed UX/UI, worked on market and user needs researches,  developed new product concepts, and helped dev teams ship quality features and be happy at work. For more details contact me and I'll be glad to send you back my cv.

I spend my free time walking my![Trudi photo](/favicon.png)[corgi](http://trudi.dog), playing weird indie games and tinkering with linux.

If you'd like to send me an email, [please do](mailto:hi@alexeygornostaev.com?subject=Hi%20from%20alexeygornostaev.com). I‚Äôd be happy to return to you. You can also check out <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@accujazz">my Mastodon feed</a>.

Cheers!
