# üëã Hi, I'm Alexey. 

I‚Äôm a product manager with over 10 years experience in building software products from the ground up.

I started my career with a personal project that was noticed and got me invited into my first full-time product management job.

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on a bunch of video-game related projects: an infotainment database with personal recommendation tools, media with custom editorial and social features, mobile in-game marketing platform and digital game distribution service.

I wrote html/css, designed UX/UI, researched user needs, developed product concepts and managed dev teams. I guess you could call me a generalist. If you‚Äôre interested, [take a look at my CV](/alexey-gornostaev-cv.pdf).

I spend my free time walking my![Trudi photo](/favicon.png)[corgi](http://trudi.dog), playing weird indie games and tinkering with linux.

[Send me an email](mailto:hello@alexeygornostaev.com), I‚Äôd be glad to return to you. You can also check out [my twitter](https://twitter.com/accujazz).

Cheers!
