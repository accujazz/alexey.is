# üëã Hi, I'm Alexey. 

I‚Äôm a product manager with over 10 years experience in building software products from the ground up.

I started my career with a bootstrapped project that got me invited into my first full-time product management job.

I launched RAWG, a video game discovery service with an open API, that was used by Microsoft, Unity, Newzoo, Blur and Yandex. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on a bunch of projects: media with in-house built editorial and social features, marketing tool for mobile game publisher, and digital game distribution service.

Cheers!
