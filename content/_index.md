# üëã Hi, I'm Alexey. 

I‚Äôm a product manager with over 10 years experience in building software products from the ground up.

I started my career with a personal project that was noticed and got me invited into my first full-time product management job.

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on a bunch of video game related projects: a video game discovery service with an open API, media with in-house built editorial and social features, mobile in-game marketing platform, and digital game distribution service. For more details contact me and I‚Äôll be glad to send you back my cv.

I spend my free time walking my![Trudi photo](/img/trudi-dog.webp)[corgi](http://trudi.dog) and playing with interactive entertainment.

If you'd like to send me an email, please do:    
hi [@] alexeygornostaev.com. I‚Äôd be happy to return to you.
