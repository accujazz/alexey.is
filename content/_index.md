# üëã Hi, I'm Alexey. 

I‚Äôm a product manager with over 10 years experience in building software products from the ground up.

I started my career with a personal project that was noticed and got me invited into my first full-time product management job.

I launched RAWG, a video game discovery service with an open API, that was used by Microsoft, Unity, Newzoo, Blur and Yandex. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on a bunch of video game related projects: media with in-house built editorial and social features, mobile in-game marketing platform, and digital game distribution service.

I spend my free time walking my![Trudi photo](/img/trudi-dog.webp)[corgi](http://trudi.dog) and playing with interactive entertainment.

I‚Äôm always looking for interesting projects to collaborate on. For more details contact me and I‚Äôll be glad to chat or send you back my cv. Reach me at: hi-at-alexeygornostaev.com.

Cheers!
