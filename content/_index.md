ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alexey. I devise, plan and manage web projects.

I started my career with a bootstrapped project that got me invited into my first full-time product management job. Nowadays I have over 10 years of experience leading product development in video game space. I co-founded a video game discovery service with an open API, that was used by Microsoft, Unity, Newzoo, Blur and Yandex.
