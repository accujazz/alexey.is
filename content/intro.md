I devise, plan and manage web projects.

I started my career with a bootstrapped project that got me invited into my first full-time product management job. Nowadays I have over 10 years of experience leading product development in video game space. I co-founded a video game discovery service with an open API, that was used by Microsoft, Unity, Newzoo, Blur and Yandex.

Iâ€™m always looking for interesting projects to collaborate on. If you have something in mind or would like to check my CV, reach me at: hi [at] alexeygornostaev.com.
