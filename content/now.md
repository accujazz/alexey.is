### Playing
[The Rise of the Golden Idol](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2716400/The_Rise_of_the_Golden_Idol/) is a perfect sequel: different (it's super rare to change the style between the games in a series!), but still weird and identifiable graphic style, more refined story and a couple of new mechanics. [Against the Storm](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336490/Against_the_Storm/) is a surprising blend of roguelike and city builder genres, not often you can see such innovative work. [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is still a perfect mobile game.

### Rubik's Cube
The first solution of Rubikâ€™s Cube I completed in approximately 4 hours. After a couple of days I could solve the cube in 15 minutes. Now in 4 minutes. Waaay harder to improve going forward!

### Software
Trying command line text editors, looks like I prefer [Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) with its simple and minimalistic approach.

### Devices
Tinkering with Android on a Pixel 8a. Like that a not very expensive phone can do everything I need. Android has gotten better than iOS in  system level UX (control center, notifications, settings). The app selection is still lacking: it's ok if you only need basic most popular apps like WhatsApp, Maps and such (they are mostly the same on every platform), but the choice of independent software like RSS readers and Podcast apps is very limited.

### TV
Something new every week, enjoyed [The Day of the Jackal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Jackal_(TV_series)), most other TV lately not so much.
