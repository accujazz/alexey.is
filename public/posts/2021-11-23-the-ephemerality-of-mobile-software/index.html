		<h1>The ephemerality of mobile software</h1>

<p>I’ve playedthrough Loom, a classic Lucas Arts adventure game, and it was fantastic to experience a 30 year old work of interactive software, that is easily playable today and has aged so gracefully. I guess, that level of accessibility is possible because of DOS, the operating system this game was designed for originally, being free to use and easy to emulate.</p>
<p>Modern mobile apps and games, on the contrary, vanish so quickly. Many many games even from a couple of years ago don’t work any more. On mobile, software has become ephemeral: the transition from 32 to 64 bit, the ever-changing system APIs, the rule that requires apps to make at least one update every two years if they don&rsquo;t want to be delisted from the app store, etc.</p>
<p>That’s very disappointing for future us. A whole generation of software could be completely lost. Loom proofs that good software design is timeless and should be preserved.</p>
