		<h1>How task trackers should deal with columns</h1>
		<div class="date-published">March 18, 2020</div>
		<p>Using project management software often means creating role-based columns and moving tasks between them from left to right. As a result a feature can be tracked during its life cycle:  Specs/Research -&gt; Design -&gt; Backend -&gt; Frontend -&gt; Testing -&gt; Done.</p>
<p>Also usually you have multiple features developed at once. Every column is someone&rsquo;s personal to do list that is populated with not related to each other tasks. Great to see who needs to do what. But not very obvious to understand the status of the general story which these tasks are part of.</p>
<p>The better flow is to devote each column to a product story. Inside the column the tasks can be grouped by role, complete mini user flows or any other suitable way. The task can be marked as in progress or done without moving to not separate it from the context.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t do this in Trello or Github. Basecamp will do but it has checklists and not columns. <a href="https://twitter.com/ColumnsApp">ColumnsApp</a> deals with columns the right way.</p>
