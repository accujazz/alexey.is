		<h1>Books via RSS</h1>
		<div class="date-published">July 22, 2020</div>
		<p>I read a lot of articles but often struggle with books. In attempt to analyze why i came to a simple realization.</p>
<p>Articles published on the web are playing by the &ldquo;web rules&rdquo; and value the readers time (another article is only a tab away already open) skipping the unnecessary and getting straight to the point.</p>
<p>The overall length of the work is no problem if the text is divided in chapters/sections that can be wholly consumed during a short session.</p>
<p>Looks like every medium today figured out that short session base consumption is generally liked by the audience. A series of articles is basically a book. Reaching the chapter to the end  frees the reader to be satisfied with the progress and be done for today.</p>
<p>Thus it would be interesting to make an RSS feed from the book. Split the text by chapters (word count optionally) and daily push a new item to the feed. Like a blog via rss.</p>
