		<h1>Digital stores influence authors creative decisions</h1>
		<div class="date-published">July 21, 2021</div>
		<p>Curious piece by <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnemann">@johnnemann</a> on the disadvantages that short niche games have on Steam.
I believe this is true for all current digital stores, not only games. And in turn it indeed changes creators behaviour.</p>
<p>Spotify encourages to release tracks faster and more often. As a result we get more singles and remixes. Apple and Google stores encourage free apps that are monetized by either in-app purchases or subscriptions. Paid apps with single purchase are a fraction of the market. Certain types of apps and games are almost gone from mobile.</p>
<p>The dynamics favour continuous delivery of content which is preferably paid by micro-transactions or feels like free (read: is subscription-based). And in the end, that is all about user engagement.</p>
<p>Consumers prefer those changes, so the current model is here to stay. And niche/short/not “modern” product will have less exposure at the time when the stores will continue to capture as much of attention as they can.</p>
<p>I obviously don’t know the answers, but in general i feel the market in addition to current stores will find a new model that will be better suited for creators of niche content. Because the demand is real.</p>
<p>If i had to guess, i would say that it will be a patreon/only fans/kickstarter like model where customers don’t pay for specific games but follow/subscribe to favourite developers with monthly payments and developers are creatively free to make whatever they wish.</p>
