      <title>The Wizard and the Prophet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember reading a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Prophet-Remarkable-Scientists-Tomorrows/dp/0307961699&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; about two scientists who, while recognizing and agreeing on problems that our planet and the environment faces, had diametrically opposed views on possible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wizard believes in unconfined innovation. Progress will eventually solve all of our problems. Our civilization is extremely good at inventing solutions, if we have the right incentives. So let’s encourage the tech!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophet, on the other hand, thinks that using more and more resources in the pursuit of an endless prosperity will ruin the planet. It has only so much to give. Let’s cut back and regulate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it feels like the continuous run of tech misfires (surveillance tech, crypto, ad tech, social web, etc.) turned industry enthusiasts from wizards into prophets. While the previous period was all about growth by all means and an endless search for something new, I feel like, people are starting to look for products, that are predictable, stable and give control to the user. Which is understandable given how big of transformations are happening in the world right now. Change is tiresome, and naturally arises a request for the familiar and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Case study: fixing DAU conversion</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/question-your-every-decision/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2023 16:31:52 +0300</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s quite rare when an update in user flow can lead to a huge change in one of the key metrics. Even more surprising when the changed screen is a standard one, widely used in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every html5 game website, the games that you can play online without a download, is structured in the same fashion. There is a homepage with a selection of games divided into genres or some other categories, the user finds a game they like and then is presented a game details page with a description, visuals, maybe some user reviews and other info, that in theory should convince the user to click on the &amp;ldquo;Play&amp;rdquo; button and convert into an active player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating such a site, we&amp;rsquo;ve noticed something weird: the mobile to desktop device ratio for our users was off: 55/45 for website visitors, but only 20% of users who play the game were doing so from a mobile device. Basically, mobile users played much less, than those who used a desktop PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there maybe a number of explanations for such behaviour: games that are not touch friendly or huge loading times, we decided to investigate the site in the first place, &amp;lsquo;cause it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper and quicker, than to tinker with each game individually. Maybe the traffic we direct into the games differs and is predominantly desktop? Nope, quite the contrary, it&amp;rsquo;s mostly mobile. Then what happens when the user lands on the site? Let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile device: click on the &amp;ldquo;Play&amp;rdquo; button or hero art launches the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/html5-games-flow-mobile.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Game screen on a mobile device&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desktop device: an iframe is automatically started with the page load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/html5-games-flow-desktop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Game screen on a desktop device&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking that something is wrong with the game details page on mobile we decided to mimic the desktop behaviour, bypass it and lead users straight to the game&amp;rsquo;s iframe, opened in fullscreen on their mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is loaded without any action from the user. The user can close the game and go to the game detail page tapping on the menu button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/html5-games-flow-mobile-changed.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Changed behaviour on a mobile device&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This change resulted in DAU growing 300%. The DAU is counted only after the game is fully loaded, which can take from 5 to 45 seconds depending on the game and connection speed, so the users who dropped during the loading process are not counted. Sure, not all of those players would become really active and complete the game tutorial, but nonetheless, at least the game will have a chance to interest players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite a surprise, that we had, what looked like a not that bad standard screen, massively hurt our performance. Again and again, I continue to learn to challenge every decision, even the ones that are accepted as common knowledge and are made on autopilot mode. Hope this post was helpful to you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whimsical cars</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every year modern cars look more and more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Nissan Qashqai from 2008 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/nissan-qashqai.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Nissan Qashqai 2008-2023&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car is bigger, the headlights are narrower, the front grille more prominent. Even in stationary the car looks like it is frozen in a moment of flying 100 km/h. You can pick any other manufacture and get a pretty similar picture. It&amp;rsquo;s dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the only aesthetic that could look modern. Look at this beauty:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/honda-e.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Honda e&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or Rivian R1T:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/rivian-r1t.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rivian R1T&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both cars don&amp;rsquo;t scream &amp;ldquo;speed&amp;rdquo;, they don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be a rocket, that could catapult you in a second from point A to B (while they definitely could, &amp;lsquo;cause electric is generally more responsive and fast). Refreshingly, they look like friendly and useful companions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Akin to a video game AI mate, that is always there to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/destiny-ghost.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ghost from Destiny&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whimsical cars are ❤️.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gig workers are contemporary XX century factory workers</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2022-11-02-gig-workers-are-contemporary-factory-workers/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2022-11-02-gig-workers-are-contemporary-factory-workers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My kid studies in a Russian online school. All classes are remote, 2 hours each, with 4 to 6 kids in a single class. The school operates akin to other modern Uber-like businesses. It connects students with teachers: collects the requests from parents, finds them a proper class, deals with payments processing and oversees the whole process to make it easier for both sides. It&amp;rsquo;s a valuable service and we were happy to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been very surprised and uneasy to learn that a math teacher in a school like that earns just $5.5 an hour. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the salaries in rural parts of Russia, but in big cities teachers in schools earn much more than that. It&amp;rsquo;s an embarrassingly low sum of money with no employment protection and no benefits. Just as it is the case with the other gig workers: taxi drivers, on-demand couriers that bring you food, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that operate those services are more often than not part of a very profitable big tech sector or venture funded with millions of dollars. You&amp;rsquo;d think they are not in need to squeeze every last penny from their workers. But that&amp;rsquo;s what they do. They want to grow fast and to do that they need to keep prices as low as possible, often much lower than the old way of getting these services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These companies have complete control over business relationship between the worker and the user - they dictate the end user pricing and then decide how much on top of that they will leave for themselves, usually in a form of 30% commission. A teacher can&amp;rsquo;t decide how much to charge her students for the class. A teacher can&amp;rsquo;t cut her expenses by using cheaper payment providers or other backend services. The only way to earn more in such a system is to work more hours. As a result a more than 10 hour work day for a teacher or taxi-driver is a common case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This situation should not be considered normal. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of faith in tech companies finding and implementing a more fair system. They&amp;rsquo;ve already had a lot of time and experience dealing with various types of gig workers, but we are still here, with no improvement. On the contrary, more types of services are being digitized and new workers get the same unhealthy conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be regulated. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the exact solution, but we could start with a simple rule. If the end user price is set by the platform, then the platform must employ the worker, with all corresponding responsibilities. If the platform doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to employ the worker and is willing to continue to treat them as an independent contractor, then they should be free to charge the user for their services however they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the workers could choose between maybe lower salary, but with the protection and benefits of an actual employment or a higher paycheck on their own terms, if they believe that the service they are providing is better than the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pretty sure that we will look back at the early days of the gig economy as an unfair and shameful period. The same way we now think about the working conditions of the early XX century factory workers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Linux is simpler than macOS</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2022-07-16-linux-is-simpler-than-macos/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2022-07-16-linux-is-simpler-than-macos/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How far we&amp;rsquo;ve come that window management on modern Linux is simpler and more straightforward than in macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In GNOME 42 all you need to learn is how to summon the Activities overview mode via hitting a button with a mouse or pressing a single (&amp;ldquo;super&amp;rdquo; by default) key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/gnome-shell.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;GNOME 42 Activities overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there you can do everything what you generally need to do with apps and window management: search for apps, see all the installed apps, manage your desktops and opened windows. One unified interface for all your window-related tasks. Learn one button and interface, and you&amp;rsquo;re good to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Mac it&amp;rsquo;s burdensome to even count all the different ways to launch apps and operate windows that Apple invented and then added one more, and more, and more. All have their own distinctive interfaces, modes of operation and shortcuts to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dock to launch favourite apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotlight to quickly launch any app and search for stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launchpad is an app that lists all your apps in an iOS-style modal view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mission control shows all opened windows and manages desktops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full screen and split view modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stage manager lets you group windows together (I&amp;rsquo;ve thought this is what Spaces is for)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this available choice, I personally still miss a core functionality and install a third-party app to get window snapping. Which, by the way, is available in GNOME out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A work of a distributed open source community is more coherent than a product of one of the most design oriented corporations in the world. Who would have thought?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The ephemerality of mobile software</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-11-23-the-ephemerality-of-mobile-software/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-11-23-the-ephemerality-of-mobile-software/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/loom.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Loom screnshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve playedthrough Loom, a classic Lucas Arts adventure game, and it was fantastic to experience a 30 year old work of interactive software, that is easily playable today and has aged so gracefully. I guess, that level of accessibility is possible because of DOS, the operating system this game was designed for originally, being free to use and easy to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern mobile apps and games, on the contrary, vanish so quickly. Many many games even from a couple of years ago don’t work any more. On mobile, software has become ephemeral: the transition from 32 to 64 bit, the ever-changing system APIs, the rule that requires apps to make at least one update every two years if they don&amp;rsquo;t want to be delisted from the app store, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s very disappointing for future us. A whole generation of software could be completely lost. Loom proofs that good software design is timeless and should be preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What web3 and NFT could mean for video games</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-10-24-what-web3-could-mean-for-video-games/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-10-24-what-web3-could-mean-for-video-games/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about what could web3 and NFTs mean for video games. And, honestly, I can&amp;rsquo;t make myself to feel excited about the current crop of P2E games. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-22-axie-infinity-economy-grind/&#34;&gt;a lot of economies in them and so little video games&lt;/a&gt;. Thoughts on how it could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand how video game items differ from art, and why unlike in art, NFTs in video games can&amp;rsquo;t be a representation of ownership. Virtual items are made up with data from various different sources: art assets, code, database record, IP ownership, etc. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raphkoster.com/2021/10/21/ownership-how-virtual-worlds-work-part-5/&#34;&gt;Dive in&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With traditional video game items there is a central database that regulates who has access to what. When you buy an item, you essentially buy a service of creating a record in the database, which will grant you an access to an item. The properties of an item (how it looks, how it affects other objects) are controlled with code and assets, that are not part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polygon.com/22709126/ethereum-creator-world-of-warcraft-nerf-nft-vitalik-buterin&#34;&gt;may change without the will of the &amp;ldquo;owner&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which sometimes results in confusion and anger. And that&amp;rsquo;s understandable. A sword with specific look and properties had been showcased to a player and bought. Not an access pass to rent it, with the looks and stats that may or may not change in the future. That is a different deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In current blockchain games when you buy an item plus to an in-game representation of it you receive an NFT token, stored in your wallet, that is separate from the game. Basically, the ownership database record part of a virtual good is being detached and put in the space owned by a user. All the other item&amp;rsquo;s properties (art, code) continue to live, where they were before the NFT invention, at some server in US-EAST-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be not a problem for art. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1451896453065023493&#34;&gt;You buy a token, that is a certificate of ownership&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you believe or not that the ownership is valuable is completely another matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for games it&amp;rsquo;s hugely important what something is: how it looks, works and behaves. See the before mentioned example with the nerfing of a WoW character. That&amp;rsquo;s why the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lootproject&#34;&gt;@lootproject&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating in that regard. It abstracts &amp;ldquo;how it looks and works&amp;rdquo; part, encouraging the community to come up with all sorts of different representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/loot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Loot bag&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they did. The community has built not only the representations for the loot itself, but has come up with characters (in several different stylistic choices), quests, maps and storylines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/lootproject.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Loot Project&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that here we can find a solution to the second part of the problem: how to grant an ownership to an item&amp;rsquo;s behaviour and its effects on the world around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am sorry, you can&amp;rsquo;t. But, moving the work to public domain, freeing the community to create as many takes on the subject as they wish. What this achieves is making valuable not an exact representation of an item, but a concept of it. Which, if you think about it, is immensely powerful. The player could still own an item, or a numbered edition of it if she wishes and have an access to a range of practical implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general concept part is more valuable than one exact implementation. May be some variant will eventually become canon, but that is up to community to decide, anyone can fork the implementation and make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/larsiusprime/status/1451629372293718020?s=20&#34;&gt;examples in video games&lt;/a&gt; that benefit from openness and where it is encouraged to mix, recreate and make collabs with characters and lore. All thanks to open source and public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs are all about making something scarce and limiting. But if you abstract enough and build on top of it, you could still have ownership of a virtual item and choose from a wide variety of fanfic implementations of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a PC</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-08-12-building-a-pc/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-08-12-building-a-pc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Custom PC builds have come a long way since that last time I assembled my own PC, which was more than ten years ago. Every part of the experience is much nicer nowadays. A plethora of high quality parts is available: cases, power supplies, storage, ram, etc. The process of building has become simpler: you need less parts, these parts connect via compact cables that are easy to deal with, bulky and noisy cd-rom or spinning hard drives are not required anymore, the fans could be dead silent, if you want them to. And the best part remains: it&amp;rsquo;s as fun and satisfying as it always has been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current build, optimized for compactness, silent operation and light gaming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streacom DA2 Mini-ITX case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMD Ryzen 4300GE with Noctua NH-U9S fan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ASRock B550 Phantom Gaming-ITX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;32Gb RAM Samsung DDR4 3200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;250Gb SSD M.2 Samsung 970 Evo Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1Tb Samsung 870 Evo SATA SSD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corsair SF600 PSU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also purchased a pair of standard Wi-Fi antennas, that need to be screwed in the ports. I like them better than a shark fin type one, that came with the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is about half of a 27&amp;quot; display in height. The side panels can be removed without a screwdriver.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/building-pc-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My new PC&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brackets can mount fans or different types of storage and be placed anywhere on the integrated track that runs along the frame of the case. Cable management is not my strong skill.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/building-pc-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;My new PC (case opened)&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I am really happy to revive an interest in an old hobby of mine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On instant games</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-27-on-instant-games/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-27-on-instant-games/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get to know the best games from my 13-year-old daughter. Personally I mostly prefer uncool niche video games, but I get very excited when I learn about a game, that is played by every second kid in the neighbourhood, because these are the games that sometimes lead to dramatic changes in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the genre, visual or gameplay perspectives these games are often not mainstream. They&amp;rsquo;re not of the extremely popular MMO or first person shooter type. Visually they are very indie, but nevertheless, or maybe even because of that, capture the minds of kids. Usually, traditional video game press and websites learn about these games much later, only after they&amp;rsquo;ve reached the level of popularity, that can&amp;rsquo;t be ignored any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Nights at Freddy&amp;rsquo;s (or FNAF to be short) was the first such game that I learned about from my kid, then there was Baldi&amp;rsquo;s Basics in Education and Learning (please, google what it looks like, I bet you&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised) and in the past year she played a lot of FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN&amp;rsquo; (that today is pretty well known in the industry) is so impressive that a new term has been invented to describe and distinguish modern web games from the old ones, that were somewhat similar, but made in Flash, rather than modern web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instant game is a game that can be played without a need to first download or install it, accessible on any device through a web browser, basically instantly available and playable via an ordinary web hyperlink. One could say the description more or less covers Flash games, social games of the pre-smartphone era and even has some hypercasual vibes in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why now? Well, because of the FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN&amp;rsquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s success story. Plus web technologies have matured enough: WebGL, fast CDN availability, video game engines with export for the Web, and a huge sea of available assets for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what&amp;rsquo;s more important, the world around us is finally ready to value games that are available just via a link. Video game streamers and tiktokers will definitely figure out how to entertain their audience with games that are accessible for everyone with a single click. Messenger apps, Reddit and Discord will help with the distribution and kill the need to deal with app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could imagine that the unique capabilities of indie games will allow not only web ports of current titles, but completely new experiences that will be build on the core values of the web platform: accessibility, multiplayer-first, linkable not only the game itself, but the in-game and player content specifically, so that anyone can share an instantly viewable race replay with a call to action to beat it or a homebase in an open world game, that they&amp;rsquo;ve put dozens of hours into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It very well may be that we&amp;rsquo;ll also see new kinds of web video game showcases, which were numerous and popular back in the days. Though, if I had to guess, I&amp;rsquo;d bet that messenger apps would be a great fit for game discovery and social tools that are always needed for any kind of healthy video game ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, I am a believer in this possible future and would like to be part of it. Looking forward to the next game I&amp;rsquo;ll learn about from my kid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notboring.co/p/infinity-revenue-infinity-possibilities&#34;&gt;pay-to-earn Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt; thing is curious, making a lot of money and you’ll absolutely hear about it soon from every corner of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t pretend I understand all of it. The game is simple (Pokemon style), the game economy is not. Though, one thing sounds like a complete red flag to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15% of Axie players cite the gameplay as their main motivation. Look, it’s a video game! That’s very low for a game and basically means that the game is not fun and people are there not for the game but for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i would guess that 15% are playing and all the others are grinding Axies (that’s what Pokemons are called here) for newcomers? To start playing the game a new player must purchase a set of Axies, that is a cornerstone of the game economy. So for every real player we have 6 workers who do the work to grind the assets for their master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional paid games this job is done by a computer automatically. Or the grinding process is actually fun which means that players are willing to do it, otherwise they would not play. In f2p games the grinding is slow, so that players either do it themselves or pay the developer to bypass it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, in crypto-games the grinding is so brutal, that the game has real humans who don&amp;rsquo;t play, but only grind and afterwards sell their work to humans who wish to start playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like a master-servant relationship. And, actually, it is indeed. According to the article 60% of users are from The Philippines, grinding virtual heroes to sell and earning a few bucks more than on their real jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even feels like we are going backwards in time! Progress is when we hire computers to do unnecessary monotonous work that was previously done by humans. And here it’s vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
