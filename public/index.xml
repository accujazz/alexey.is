      <title>What web3 and NFT could mean for video games</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about what could web3 and NFTs mean for video games. And, honestly, I can&amp;rsquo;t make myself to feel excited about the current crop of P2E games. There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-22-axie-infinity-economy-grind/&#34;&gt;a lot of economies in them and so little video games&lt;/a&gt;. Thoughts on how it could change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to understand how video game items differ from art, and why unlike in art, NFTs in video games can&amp;rsquo;t be a representation of ownership. Virtual items are made up with data from various different sources: art assets, code, database record, IP ownership, etc. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raphkoster.com/2021/10/21/ownership-how-virtual-worlds-work-part-5/&#34;&gt;Dive in&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With traditional video game items there is a central database that regulates who has access to what. When you buy an item, you essentially buy a service of creating a record in the database, which will grant you an access to an item. The properties of an item (how it looks, how it affects other objects) are controlled with code and assets, that are not part of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.polygon.com/22709126/ethereum-creator-world-of-warcraft-nerf-nft-vitalik-buterin&#34;&gt;may change without the will of the &amp;ldquo;owner&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which sometimes results in confusion and anger. And that&amp;rsquo;s understandable. A sword with specific look and properties had been showcased to a player and bought. Not an access pass to rent it, with the looks and stats that may or may not change in the future. That is a different deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In current blockchain games when you buy an item plus to an in-game representation of it you receive an NFT token, stored in your wallet, that is separate from the game. Basically, the ownership database record part of a virtual good is being detached and put in the space owned by a user. All the other item&amp;rsquo;s properties (art, code) continue to live, where they were before the NFT invention, at some server in US-EAST-1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may be not a problem for art. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1451896453065023493&#34;&gt;You buy a token, that is a certificate of ownership&lt;/a&gt;. Whether you believe or not that the ownership is valuable is completely another matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for games it&amp;rsquo;s hugely important what something is: how it looks, works and behaves. See the before mentioned example with the nerfing of a WoW character. That&amp;rsquo;s why the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lootproject&#34;&gt;@lootproject&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating in that regard. It abstracts &amp;ldquo;how it looks and works&amp;rdquo; part, encouraging the community to come up with all sorts of different representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/loot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Loot bag&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they did. The community has built not only the representations for the loot itself, but has come up with characters (in several different stylistic choices), quests, maps and storylines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/lootproject.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The Loot Project&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would argue that here we can find a solution to the second part of the problem: how to grant an ownership to an item&amp;rsquo;s behaviour and its effects on the world around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am sorry, you can&amp;rsquo;t. But, moving the work to public domain, freeing the community to create as many takes on the subject as they wish. What this achieves is making valuable not an exact representation of an item, but a concept of it. Which, if you think about it, is immensely powerful. The player could still own an item, or a numbered edition of it if she wishes and have an access to a range of practical implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general concept part is more valuable than one exact implementation. May be some variant will eventually become canon, but that is up to community to decide, anyone can fork the implementation and make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/larsiusprime/status/1451629372293718020?s=20&#34;&gt;examples in video games&lt;/a&gt; that benefit from openness and where it is encouraged to mix, recreate and make collabs with characters and lore. All thanks to open source and public domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs are all about making something scarce and limiting. But if you abstract enough and build on top of it, you could still have ownership of a virtual item and choose from a wide variety of fanfic implementations of it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On instant games</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-27-on-instant-games/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-27-on-instant-games/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get to know the best games from my 13-year-old daughter. Personally i mostly prefer uncool niche video games, but i get very excited when i learn about a game, that is played by every second kid in the neighbourhood, because these are the games that sometimes lead to dramatic changes in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the genre, visual or gameplay perspectives these games are often not mainstream. They&amp;rsquo;re not of the extremely popular MMO or first person shooter type. Visually they are very indie, but nevertheless, or maybe even because of that, capture the minds of kids. Usually, traditional video game press and websites learn about these games much later, only after they&amp;rsquo;ve reached the level of popularity, that can&amp;rsquo;t be ignored any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Nights at Freddy&amp;rsquo;s (or FNAF to be short) was the first such game that i learned about from my kid, then there was Baldi&amp;rsquo;s Basics in Education and Learning (please, google what it looks like, i bet you&amp;rsquo;ll be surprised) and in the past year she played a lot of FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN&#39; (that today is pretty well known in the industry) is so impressive that a new term has been invented to describe and distinguish modern web games from the old ones, that were somewhat similar, but made in Flash, rather than modern web technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instant game is a game that can be played without a need to first download or install it, accessible on any device through a web browser, basically instantly available and playable via an ordinary web hyperlink. One could say the description more or less covers Flash games, social games of the pre-smartphone era and even has some hypercasual vibes in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why now? Well, because of the FRIDAY NIGHT FUNKIN&#39; and it&amp;rsquo;s success story. Plus web technologies have matured enough: WebGL, fast CDN availability, video game engines with export for the Web, and a huge sea of available assets for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what&amp;rsquo;s more important, the world around us is finally ready to value games that are available just via a link. Video game streamers and tiktokers will definitely figure out how to entertain their audience with games that are accessible for everyone with a single click. Messenger apps, Reddit and Discord will help with the distribution and kill the need to deal with app stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could imagine that the unique capabilities of indie games will allow not only web ports of current titles, but completely new experiences that will be build on the core values of the web platform: accessibility, multiplayer-first, linkable not only the game itself, but the in-game and player content specifically, so that anyone can share an instantly viewable race replay with a call to action to beat it or a homebase in an open world game, that they&amp;rsquo;ve put dozens of hours into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It very well may be that we&amp;rsquo;ll also see new kinds of web video game showcases, which were numerous and popular back in the days. Though, if i had to guess, i would bet that messenger apps would be a great fit for game discovery and social tools that are always needed for any kind of healthy video game ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may have noticed, i am a believer in this possible future and would like to be part of it. Looking forward to the next game i&amp;rsquo;ll learn about from my kid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Axie Infinity&#39;s economy is based on humans who do computer work</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-22-axie-infinity-economy-grind/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-22-axie-infinity-economy-grind/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notboring.co/p/infinity-revenue-infinity-possibilities&#34;&gt;pay-to-earn Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt; thing is curious, making a lot of money and you’ll absolutely hear about it soon from every corner of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t pretend I understand all of it. The game is simple (Pokemon style), the game economy is not. Though, one thing sounds like a complete red flag to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15% of Axie players cite the gameplay as their main motivation. Look, it’s a video game! That’s very low for a game and basically means that the game is not fun and people are there not for the game but for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So i would guess that 15% are playing and all the others are grinding Axies (that’s what Pokemons are called here) for newcomers? To start playing the game a new player must purchase a set of Axies, that is a cornerstone of the game economy. So for every real player we have 6 workers who do the work to grind the assets for their master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In traditional paid games this job is done by a computer automatically. Or the grinding process is actually fun which means that players are willing to do it, otherwise they would not play. In f2p games the grinding is slow, so that players either do it themselves or pay the developer to bypass it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, in crypto-games the grinding is so brutal, that the game has real humans who don&amp;rsquo;t play, but only grind and afterwards sell their work to humans who wish to start playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This looks like a master-servant relationship. And, actually, it is indeed. According to the article 60% of users are from The Philippines, grinding virtual heroes to sell and earning a few bucks more than on their real jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even feels like we are going backwards in time! Progress is when we hire computers to do unnecessary monotonous work that was previously done by humans. And here it’s vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital stores influence authors creative decisions</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-21-digital-stores-influence-creative-decisions/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-21-digital-stores-influence-creative-decisions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Curious piece by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/johnnemann&#34;&gt;@johnnemann&lt;/a&gt; on the disadvantages that short niche games have on Steam.
I believe this is true for all current digital stores, not only games. And in turn it indeed changes creators behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify encourages to release tracks faster and more often. As a result we get more singles and remixes. Apple and Google stores encourage free apps that are monetized by either in-app purchases or subscriptions. Paid apps with single purchase are a fraction of the market. Certain types of apps and games are almost gone from mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics favour continuous delivery of content which is preferably paid by micro-transactions or feels like free (read: is subscription-based). And in the end, that is all about user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers prefer those changes, so the current model is here to stay. And niche/short/not “modern” product will have less exposure at the time when the stores will continue to capture as much of attention as they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I obviously don’t know the answers, but in general i feel the market in addition to current stores will find a new model that will be better suited for creators of niche content. Because the demand is real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If i had to guess, i would say that it will be a patreon/only fans/kickstarter like model where customers don’t pay for specific games but follow/subscribe to favourite developers with monthly payments and developers are creatively free to make whatever they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was originally published as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/accujazz/status/1415715734693502980?s=20&#34;&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A round-up of the recent articles on where things are headed in video game space</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-07-03-roundup-articles-video-game-space-future/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ll ask me what recent shifts in the video game industry I view as the most interesting and aspiring i&amp;rsquo;ll point you to these insightful observations made by other people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/08/work-can-virtual-meeting-spaces-save-us-all-from-zoom-fatigue&#34;&gt;Can virtual meeting spaces save us all from Zoom fatigue?&lt;/a&gt; Pandemic has changed a lot of our social and work-related perceptions and it isn&amp;rsquo;t likely we&amp;rsquo;ll move back to how things were prior. We are rethinking the work processes: hybrid and remote work are the new normal, video call is the default way of having a meeting, and corporations now onboard many employees virtually rather than on-site. The tools we&amp;rsquo;ve created in the last decade worked for the most part and made the shift to remote work and social life painless, but we are still in the beginning and a lot of startups will focus on rethinking tools for communication and collaboration. Video game like social spaces are starting to emerge and use the advantages of spatial interfaces and game mechanics to bring  virtual closer to real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jonlai.co/game-like&#34;&gt;The Best Apps Today are
Games in Disguise&lt;/a&gt;. The best apps today use video game mechanics in their core product design. Fun is the new powermetric because users naturally gravitate to the most rewarding experience. When people have fun and feel they are achieving their goals, they build long-term habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://future.a16z.com/instant-games/&#34;&gt;The Future of Games Is Instant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fortressofdoors.com/the-future-of-games-is-an-instant-flash-to-the-past/&#34;&gt;The Future of Games is an Instant Flash to the past&lt;/a&gt;. Could instant games, i.e games that are frictionless, instantly playable no matter the device, accessible through links, and cross-platform be the future and what the embedded social aspect of the web and hyperlynking will change about how we develop and distribute games?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fortressofdoors.com/so-you-want-to-compete-with-roblox/&#34;&gt;So You Want to Compete with Roblox&lt;/a&gt;. Roblox was numerous times mentioned during Apple/Epic trial and is one the most talked about companies in the industry. You also can&amp;rsquo;t exclude the topic of Roblox when talking about platforms, distribution, platform fees and tools for creators. Each of which is in itself one of the most think about topics in the industry right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>What is gamification</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-06-08-what-is-gamification/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-06-08-what-is-gamification/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently got interested in the topic of using game mechanics in consumer software products and stumbled upon an old, but still useful talk by Gabe Zichermann on gamification. Today gamification is not a trendy word as it used to be and it got somewhat spoiled by many basic and not well-thought-out implementations of achievements and leaderboards. However, the underlying principles are based on modern game design with the goal of making software more fun and the users more motivated. That task is as relevant as ever. I encourage you to find time and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O1gNVeaE4g&amp;amp;t&#34;&gt;watch the whole talk&lt;/a&gt;. Below are my notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamification is the process of using the game thinking and mechanics to engage audiences and solve problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If Shakespeare lived in the modern world he could say &amp;ldquo;All the world is a game&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are games about being a traffic controller, a farmer. Fun and theme are not related. Theme is a lure to bring people in. If a job of a traffic controller can be fun then anything could be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carmen vs. Sandiego released in the 80-s is still the last successful educational game. Why? Because parents and teachers became involved in designing games and kids smell that shit instantly. In parallel Civilzation and Sim City almost invisibly taught people basic history lessons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One could say that gamification is non-fiction gaming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick loyalty programs history:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1800s: tangible goods (buy 10 items get 1 free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1930s: cash incentives (collect tickets when buying goods. almost like a virtual currency, hard to do the math for a consumer) -&amp;gt; collect X and then redeem them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1980s: loyalty systems (it&amp;rsquo;s about status more than about free stuff)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2000s: virtual rewards (no real money as a reward, only a status).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no money out from Farmville or Foursquare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loyalty choices are now public. Because word of mouth is more predictable (Zynga knows how) than in the old days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gamification loop: challenges -&amp;gt; win conditions -&amp;gt; leaderboards -&amp;gt; badges -&amp;gt; social networking -&amp;gt; status. A point system at the heart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users naturally gravitate to the most rewarding experience. By definition games have an advantage. They are designed to be rewarding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Main player types: achiever, explorer, killer and socializer.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;socializer: lightweight, non-confrontation, easy interactions. This is the most common one - around 80% of players.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;achiever: beat the game, i want to win.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;explorer: find all the secrets and signal it to the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;killer: i win, you loose. beat the opponent and signal it to the crowd.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fun is the new powermetric. Because, as we&amp;rsquo;ve said earlier, -&amp;gt; users naturally gravitate to the most rewarding experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaderboard in an arcade: top 20 scores. A user sees huge scores and doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe he can reach them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern leaderboard: no matter where a user really is in the leaderboard we show them in the middle, two friends below, two friends on top and a message what to do to move up. Exception: when a user is literally in top 20.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Onboarding - is level 1. Player is put right away in a game, in a very controlled path with fast gratification, only after completing he is asked to register. Very different from the web landing sign up flow which usually starts with the registration step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every single touch point is an opportunity to convert a user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you interested in more of a motivational kind of talk on how video games can change the world for the better i recommend a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ted.com/talks/jane_mcgonigal_gaming_can_make_a_better_world?language=en&#34;&gt;TED Talk by Jane McGonigal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why there are a lot of shades of grey in Apple&#39;s ATT initiative</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-04-07-shades-of-grey-in-att-initiative/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/2021-04-07-shades-of-grey-in-att-initiative/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Soon the ATT (App Tracking Transparency) will be rolling out on iPhones. ATT is a system that mandates apps to ask users if they are willing to allow apps to track them across other apps and the web. Looks like all positive, but not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT, as all other recent initiatives around privacy, draws an easy to understand border on what data it is ok to grab silently and what first needs to be asked for. Simply speaking, first-party (the data is sent to the same domain the user is on) data collection is ok, third-party - not ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, you can collect in your own database anything you want. But it is considered suspicious to send same data to the database on the server belonging to another company. Looks reasonable, but there are a lot of shades of grey here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General consensus that huge ad platforms (read Facebook and Google) will suffer most from these changes, because they are all third-party agents here and as a result will loose a lot of valuable customer insights that allow them to be efficient with ad targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End consumer apps have a lot of data about customer engagement, but signals that are most valuable for conversion actions are mostly coming from external sources. Will a user consider to buy your product, download a game, signup for a trial period?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad targeting is possible because of this data. Match-3 game developer can show ads about his game to people who love and play this type of games. Ad networks know these things about the users, your favourite app does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ATT it will be harder for advertisers (e-commerce, games, saas services, online education, etc.) to get new clients for the same money. Because there will be less data, less users and as a result the price for acquiring audience will rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big tech will need to look for new revenue sources. And if first-party = good and third-party = bad, it will be logical to gather as much data as they could by themselves - to create products that will generate such data: games, e-commerce, education, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could lead to even more monopolization and competition with small businesses. Which as result will suffer most. First, it could become harder to reach new audience and secondly they will have a new competitor, Facebook or Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Apple needs from all of this? iOS privacy superiority over Android is certainly a factor, but there is another goal: to return control of app discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ads are the main source of app installs. So not Apple is affecting which apps will become popular and how the users will use their phones, but Facebook. One can argue that today App Store is an annoying unnecessary layer with a download button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple wants it to be like before when App Store was used for discovery of new apps, when featuring was a tool to influence and direct to what is good for the platform in Apple&amp;rsquo;s mind. May be, Apple Arcade would be much more popular and bring more revenue if only the discovery process was still in the Apple&amp;rsquo;s hands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is mostly based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://stratechery.com/2021/an-interview-with-eric-seufert-about-apple-facebook-and-mobile-advertising/&#34;&gt;An Interview with Eric Seufert about Apple, Facebook, and Mobile Advertising&lt;/a&gt;  and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mobiledevmemo.com/surveillance-advertising-is-a-myth/&#34;&gt;Surveillance advertising is a myth&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend reading them if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the topic, they are much more comprehensive than my short take on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How much good journalism is worth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Surprising how in 2021 we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that the deal between media companies and authors is absolutely not beneficial to the latter: &lt;a href=&#34;https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/&#34;&gt;Sovereign Writers and Substack&lt;/a&gt; by Ben Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time it was obvious that paying same salaries or base the payments on volume (often calculated by number of produced characters) is not an effective way to pay for writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies began to experiment paying based on performance. Usually measuring page views and how many people have read through the whole article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of problems with such schemes. For example they often push to produce clickbait or sensational content that could easily generate clicks. I am not sure if a lot of companies do that now. I guess not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But turns out that the best authors bring much more value to the publications than any bonus they could get after such performance review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks to Substack the proof now is visible and apparent to everyone. We now know how much money the audience is ready to pay for author&amp;rsquo;s work. Several times more than they could get in any publication!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as soon as the world became ready (payment processing on the web, subscriptions) a business model emerged that showed the real value of high quality journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now apparent how much money publications are making from their best authors. And how inefficient the media business model (i am talking about ads of course) is to take advantage of that value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, maybe people are not ready now to pay for all types of journalism. And you must have a starter audience to begin earning something from writing. But it is now obvious how much money in the author -&amp;gt; media -&amp;gt; reader relationship the middleman is getting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making group competition flow x100 more simple and efficient</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/making-group-competition-flow-x100-more-simple-and-efficient/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2021 16:57:54 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/making-group-competition-flow-x100-more-simple-and-efficient/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our team was working on a tournament platform for competitive video games. The players could browse tournaments for the games they play, find what they like, register to play and record scores. The app helped to manage tournament participants, score recording, pair competitors against each other and determined which players would advance to the next stages based on a set of tournament rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The player could join a tournament either as individual competitor or as part of the team. We had a pretty complex flow for team tournaments and quickly saw in the session recordings that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. For some users it could take for up to 30(!) minutes to join the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no surprise why if we list all the steps our imaginary player Mike would need to complete in order to register for a team competition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike lands on a tournament page with an intent to join a team tournament&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First he needs to create an account filling all the required fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then Mike clicks on &amp;ldquo;Join&amp;rdquo; button again only to find out that he needs to have a team, cause only team owners can join team tournaments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not a given but let&amp;rsquo;s for a moment assume that Mike regularly plays his favourite game with his friends as part of the same team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thankfully there is a &amp;ldquo;Create new team&amp;rdquo; button in the message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike clicks it and is presented with a form that asks Mike to come up with team name, upload a team avatar, write something in the description, select team size. Not all the fields are required. But still a lot of work. Arghhh!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the team is created Mike needs to invite his friends to it. He can send invites via email or just copy an invite link and send it to his friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike tries again to join the tournament but he still can&amp;rsquo;t. Tournament requires the teams of 4 people in size and Mike&amp;rsquo;s friends haven&amp;rsquo;t yet responded to his invitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike pings his mates in chat, waits till they sign up for the site and join his team. He refreshes the team members page to check if all the members are in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally Mike returns to the tournament page clicks Join and is able to register for the competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, what an embarrassing experience! This must be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully we have a group events pattern that after the pandemic experience of 2020 is familiar and used by millions of people. We spend our days in group video calls and not all of them have a built in contact list. This is especially relevant for new products cause your friends are not there. But it is still pretty easy to organize a meeting. You create a new call, copy the invite link and send it the way you like. Everybody who has a link can join. New meeting with another group of people? Simple. New invite link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing stopping team tournaments to work the same way and Mike&amp;rsquo;s flow would simplify drastically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike sign ups for the service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike clicks to join the team tournament. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if he already has a team or not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike receives an invite-link and sends it to his friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When enough players sign up and join with this link the team is formed and can play in a competition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every player has a history of who he played with and can join future tournaments selecting one of the previous groups or by grabbing an invite link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alexeygornostaev.com/img/posts/tournament-team-flow.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tournament team flow&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have simplified the user flow increasing the conversion to tournament participations, got rid of unnecessary entities and screens that were needed to support the &amp;ldquo;Team&amp;rdquo; model and reduced the codebase making it easier to support and add new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect the solution seems obvious and simple but simplicity is never a given, it takes work to achieve. People tend to overthink and overcomplicate things.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Video games industry is the best</title>
      <link>https://alexeygornostaev.com/posts/video-games-business-models/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Video games is the only entertainment industry where several business models are successfully used at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time it seemed like the music industry was struggling the most but in the end it is first to live completely in the future. Streaming takes 85% off the market growing from 80% only a year ago. The retail sales are around $5 billion per year but they do not affect or relevant to the market anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The period of retail sales dominance was an era of huge worldwide stars. If you wanted to sell big you needed to be on the radio and later on MTV. The number of broadcast placements was finite, so those who were able to take a prime spot would become mega popular. Everyone else could aim for local popularity but not much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today everyone has access to all the songs in the world. Turns out music is very different and there are listeners for pretty much every niche genre that could come to your mind. Hundreds of thousands of artists can find an audience and earn money not just the ones that got a blessing from major labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime the movie industry has not even been able to come to peace with the reality. The pandemic of 2020 killed all new releases. Tenet, one of the most promising titles of the year, didn&amp;rsquo;t sell enough tickets. Everybody freaked out and moved all the releases to 2021 and beyond. And they want to believe it is Covid related and soon will pass. But it will not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie industry produces around 10 blockbusters per year. The production costs are so high that these titles need to be mega popular worldwide or they are bust. So they need to appeal to everybody. This leads to safe and uninspiring content. And don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on the whole &amp;ldquo;cinema watching experience&amp;rdquo; in a time of huge OLED TV&amp;rsquo;s at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix is releasing 3000 items of content per year. For you, me and for Adam Sandler fans also. TV series cover a vast range of themes and stories. They move into the topics that could never succeed as a cinema release. But streaming makes it possible to find enough of even a very niche audience. As long as you&amp;rsquo;re a Netflix subscriber everybody is happy. TV series are relevant and part of the public discourse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The books industry is a great example that progress should not be stopped. Everything was great until a couple of bad legislations haven&amp;rsquo;t messed with pricing. And now ebooks often cost more at Amazon than softcovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only in video games you can find successful subscription model (GamesPass, Apple Arcade), online distribution (Steam), micro-transactions (F2P), ad-based (free with ads). And all these models are growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently not a single reason is visible that could hinder this diversity. Games are so different from each other that there is a healthy market for all these models. Free2Play for casual games, online distribution for pc indie and AAA console games, subscription for AA console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future in games turned out to be better and more flexible than anywhere else.🎂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post started as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/accujazz/status/1305045835269496833?s=20&#34;&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; (In Russian).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
