<p>2020-2021<br>
<strong>Gather</strong><br>
I consulted on product development a US-based startup that was building a platform for creating tournaments and competitions for online video games.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can read <a href="/posts/making-group-competition-flow-x100-more-simple-and-efficient/">Making Group Competition Flow x100 More Simple and Efficient</a> to get an idea of the problems that I was solving.</li>
</ul>
<p>2017-2021<br>
<strong>RAWG</strong><br>
Co-founded a Lithuania-based <a href="https://rawg.io/">video game discovery site</a> (think the movie diary Letterboxd meets IMDb). We launched an open API that was being used by people from <a href="https://yandex.com">Yandex</a>, <a href="https://unity.com">Unity</a>, <a href="http://www.blur.com">Blur</a> and other fine companies. You can read a couple of essays from that time:</p>
<ul>
<li>An introductory essay into the discoverability problem: <a href="/posts/video-game-markets-fail-at-recommending-games/">Video Game Markets Fail at Recommending Games</a>.</li>
<li>Announcement post: <a href="/posts/you-have-nothing-to-play/">You Have Nothing to Play</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>2013-2017<br>
<strong>Rambler Games / Kanobu</strong><br>
Lead product at a Russian <a href="https://kanobu.ru/">video games media</a> with a monthly audience of 5 million people. Lead the SEO efforts and by the 2016 we doubled our audience numbers, lead the transition of page templates to adaptive mobile-friendly layouts, have been responsible for the concept and development of a new block-styled editor tool for publishing articles in a visually rich way.</p>
<p>2012<br>
<strong>Game Insight</strong><br>
Worked on a mobile in-game marketing and support platform for <a href="https://www.game-insight.com/en">Game Insight</a>. At the time it was maybe the most feature rich in-game support service: a cross-promo system, user accounts, user support, user statistics, other games showcase and game news. We released the project for iOS titles (18 games, several millions DAU) and ported the client to Android.</p>
<p>2011<br>
<strong>Rambler Games / Kanobu</strong><br>
Was responsible for creating a local video games digital distribution service. Kanobu was an editorial/ugc-fueled publication and completely relied on advertising revenue. The goal was to create a second revenue stream. As is often the case when working in a small company, I wore a lot of hats: defined and drove the feature roadmap, managed the development, made direct contributions to ux/ui design and provided customer support.</p>
<hr>
<p>I love to experiment and have worked on a few personal projects over the years. Most of them are long offline, but the experience remains:</p>
<ul>
<li>An online tool to create short compilations of your favourite songs. The tracks were automatically cut in 11-seconds parts and mixed together with seamless transitions at their beginnings and endings with fades. The end result was sort of a bite-sized mixtape.</li>
<li>A plain text file format praise: different ways to use plain text files.</li>
<li>A chart of the mobile apps most often mentioned in social media.</li>
<li>A tool to view all replies to a single tweet, back in the day when it was impossible to do so on Twitter.</li>
<li>A video games price aggregator, build when the transition to digital was still in progress and video games were sold on all kinds of media.</li>
</ul>
