		<h1>Work</h1>
		<div class="date-published">October 14, 2021</div>
		<p>I&rsquo;ve been working remotely for the last 5+ years. I am interested in the processes that help understand customer needs,  build the right things and skip unnecessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>I consulted on product development a US-based startup that is building a platform for creating tournaments and competitions for online video games.
<ul>
<li>You can read <a href="/posts/making-group-competition-flow-x100-more-simple-and-efficient/">Making Group Competition Flow x100 More Simple and Efficient</a> to get an idea of the problems that I was solving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Co-founded a Lithuania-based <a href="https://rawg.io/">video game discovery site</a>
(think the movie diary Letterboxd meets IMDb). We launched an open API that is used by people from <a href="https://yandex.com">Yandex</a>, <a href="https://unity.com">Unity</a>, <a href="http://www.blur.com">Blur</a> and other fine companies. You can read a couple of essays from that time:
<ul>
<li>An introductory essay into the discoverability problem: <a href="/posts/video-game-markets-fail-at-recommending-games/">Video Game Markets Fail at Recommending Games</a>.</li>
<li>Announcement post: <a href="/posts/you-have-nothing-to-play/">You Have Nothing to Play</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lead product at a Russian <a href="https://kanobu.ru/">video games media</a> with a monthly audience of ~5 million people.</li>
<li>Worked on a mobile in-game marketing and support platform for <a href="https://www.game-insight.com/en">Game Insight</a>.</li>
<li>Was responsible for creating a local video games digital distribution service.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I love to experiment and have worked on a few personal projects over the years. Most of them are long offline, but the experience remains:</p>
<ul>
<li>An online tool to create short compilations of your favourite songs. The tracks were automatically cut in 11-seconds parts and mixed together with seamless transitions at their beginnings and endings with fades. The end result was sort of a bite-sized mixtape.</li>
<li>A plain text file format praise: different ways to use plain text files.</li>
<li>A chart of the mobile apps most often mentioned in social media.</li>
<li>A tool to view all replies to a single tweet, back in the day when it was impossible to do so on Twitter.</li>
<li>A video games price aggregator, build when the transition to digital was still in progress and video games were sold on all kinds of media.</li>
</ul>
